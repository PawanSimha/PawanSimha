👋 Hi, I'm Pawan Simha

I'm a Computer Science enthusiast driven by logic, structured thinking, and evidence-based learning. I enjoy understanding how systems work beneath the surface, whether it’s machine learning models, software architecture, or product strategy. My long-term goal is to grow into a Machine Learning Engineer and eventually transition into product leadership, where technology meets strategic decision-making.

🎓 What I’m Doing
I’m currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) in Bangalore at Sapthagiri NPS University.

My focus areas include:
🤖 Machine Learning & AI
💻 Software/Website Development
🧠 DSA and Ui/Ux Designs
📦 Being an AI Product manager

I actively work on projects to strengthen both my engineering depth and product intuition.
